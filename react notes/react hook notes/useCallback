use callback caches a function so that is survives re render cycles.

on a re render of a component the filteredIngredientsHandler function would have been re created every time and it would be a new 
function object. If this function would have been called inside useEffect it would cause it to execute again. 

  const filteredIngredientsHandler = useCallback( (filteredIngredients) => {
    setUserIngredients(filteredIngredients);
  }, []);
